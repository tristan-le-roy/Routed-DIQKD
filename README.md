Plots and python scripts that reproduce rates of routed and non-routed DIQKD protocols found in "TODO: arxiv link". Computations are based on the work [arxiv:2106.13692](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13692).

IMPORTANT: The implementation works best with the latest version of the python package ncpol2sdpa. To find the latest version please install directly from this [github fork](https://github.com/peterjbrown519/ncpol2sdpa).
